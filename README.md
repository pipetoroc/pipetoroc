ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Felipe Toro but my friends usually call me Pipe. I am a web developer, frontend specialist and continuous student of new tools and technologies. ðŸ“š

I'm passionate about creating functional and inclusive web pages that capture the attention of users with unique and differentiated designs.ðŸ’»

With my experience in sales, technical support and my academic background in civil engineering, I got to develop organization skills that I use in responsive design,
semantic HTML and a structured CCS, resulting in optimal performance web pages. My experience in the product research and development area allowed me to develop
analytical and structured thinking to face challenges and always look for the best alternatives to solve problems.ðŸ“ˆ
